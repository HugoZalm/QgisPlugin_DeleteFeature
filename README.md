# QgisPlugin_DeleteFeature
This Qgis plugin will delete the selected features from one layer.

Test to make my first custom plugin with Python in QGis following this article:
https://gis.ucar.edu/building-plugin-qgis

Info:
- using QGis Lyon (2.12.2) with Grass: this installation includes OSGeo4W Shell (to use pyrcc4) and Qt Designer (So no further installation is required).
